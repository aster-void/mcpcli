# AGENTS.md

Guidelines for agents working on this repository. Avoid destructive operations and behavioral ambiguity, prioritize explicit failures and simple procedures.
It may seem you are looking at CLAUDE.md, but this is AGENTS.md.

## Project Overview

- climcp built with bun. `climcp connect <command...>` starts and interacts with a server, `climcp run "tool" <command...>` executes once.
- Exit codes follow the policy described in README, clearly separating user errors from connection-related errors.

## Top Priority Principles

- Make failures explicit: Don't suppress errors. Don't silence with `|| true`. Avoid suppression with `if pkgs ? foo`.
- Plan before working: Proceed in order: investigation → plan presentation → approval.
- Confirm before destructive operations: Obtain y/n approval before execution (exception only when user instruction contains `--yes`).
- Fix one cause at a time: Identify the cause, resolve one issue at a time, and re-execute.
- Don't detour: If the initial plan fails, present the next plan and obtain confirmation before proceeding.

## Basic Flow

1. Build or operational verification
2. Find the bug cause and fix it
3. Build or operational verification

## Development Commands

```sh
bun run build # build the package
bun test      # run tests
bun check     # run type check + tests
```

## Command Tree

- `bun run build` → type-check + bundle + copy assets
- `bun test` → unit tests + CLI integration tests
- `bun check` → type-check + tests

## Nix / Flake Notes

- New files may not be visible to flake without `git add -N path`. Example: do `git add packages/foo.nix -N` before `nix run .#foo`.

## Coding/Change Policy

- Code should be self-explanatory, with only minimal necessary comments.
- Prioritize explicit arguments and error handling over implicit defaults.
- Don't break existing behavior or exit code policies.

## Repository-Specific Coding Guidelines

- Keep src/index.ts minimal.
- `as` and `any` are absolutely forbidden. Seriously, you'll get in trouble if you use them.
  - except for `as const` and `import * as foo from ...`. these are safe.
